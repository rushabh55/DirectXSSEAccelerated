Volume simulator, simulating an incompressible fluid solving the Navier - Stokes differential equations. 
The simulation runs in a 200x200x200 voxel box

Space bar           : toggle between MacCormack and Semi-Lagrangian simulation
Mouse left          : drags a source on a plane through the center of the volume and parallel to the screen
Mouse right         : rotates volume
Mouse wheel         : zoom in/out
